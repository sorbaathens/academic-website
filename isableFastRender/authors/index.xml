      <description>&lt;p&gt;SORBA Athens is a 501(3)c non-profit organization located in Athens, GA focused on increasing access to multi-use trails open to mountain bikes. We are one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sorba.org/chapters/&#34;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://sorba.org&#34;&gt;Southern Off-Road Bicycle Association (SORBA)&lt;/a&gt; chapters which has over 7000 members and is growing. Our primary mission is to increase access to sustainable trails open to mountain bikes in and around Athens, GA. We partner with land managers and other organizations to advocate for access to facilities and resources to make mountain biking a more accessible sport for everyone, especially beginners and kids. We built and maintain the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:57219/#trails&#34;&gt;mountain bike trails&lt;/a&gt; at Heritage Park and Trail Creek Park and help maintain Hawkes Creek Farm and other local trails as much as possible. Soon we will begin construction of a pump track and skills course at Trail Creek Park. With an eye to the future we have an agreement with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fireflytrail.com/&#34;&gt;Firefly Trail, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to build a singletrack trail parallel to the Firefly Trail in the town of Maxey&#39;s and we hope to find more parallel trail opportunities as the Firefly is constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us at one of our &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:57219/events/&#34;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:57219/donate/&#34;&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt; to one of our trail funds, see other ways to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:57219/get_involved/&#34;&gt;get involved&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sorbaathens@gmail.com&#34;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; for more details! We&#39;re all volunteers with day jobs and limited time, but we don&#39;t turn down help!&lt;/p&gt;
