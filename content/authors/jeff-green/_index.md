Jeff is from Athens, GA and grew up riding bikes, but is relatively new to mountain biking. Jeff reached out to the board wanting to help and we put him to work triming the trails at Trail Creek Park. Due to his hard work and willingness to help Jeff was nominated and elected to the secretary position and he is eager to contribute to our forward progress.
