SORBA Athens is the only non-profit organization in Athens, GA focused on increasing access to multi-use trails open to bikes. We are one of [46](https://sorba.org/chapters/) [Southern Off-Road Bicycle Association (SORBA)](https://sorba.org) chapters which has over 8000 members. Our primary mission is to increase access to sustainable trails open to bicycles near Athens, GA. We want mountain biking to be more accessible to everyone, especially beginners, children and families. We built and maintain the [trails](/#trails) at [Heritage Park](/trails/heritage-park/) and [Walker Park](/trails/trail-creek/) (formerly Trail Creek) and help maintain [Hawkes Creek Farm](/trails/hawkes-creek/) and [Hart Farms](/trails/hart-farms/). We are building a [pump track](/pump-track/) and skills course at Walker Park. We have an agreement with [Firefly Trail, Inc.](https://www.fireflytrail.com/) to build natural surface trail segments parallel to the Firefly and we hope to find more parallel trail opportunities in the future.

Please join us at one of our [events](/events/), [donate](/donate/) to one of our trail funds, see other ways to [engage](/get_involved/), or [contact us](mailto:sorbaathens@gmail.com) for more details! We're all volunteers with day jobs and limited time, but we don't turn down help!
