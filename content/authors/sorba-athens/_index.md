SORBA Athens is a 501(3)(c) non-profit organization located in Athens, GA focused on increasing access to multi-use trails open to mountain bikes. We are one of [46](https://sorba.org/chapters/) [Southern Off-Road Bicycle Association (SORBA)](https://sorba.org) chapters which has 7000 members and is growing. Our primary mission is to increase access to mountain biking in and around Athens, GA. We partner with land managers and other organizations to advocate for access to facilities and resources to make mountain biking a more accessible sport for everyone, especially beginners and kids. We built and maintain the mountain bike trails at [Heritage Park](/trails/) and [Trail Creek Park](/trails/). We also help maintain [Hawkes Creek Farm] and other local trails as much as possible. Soon we will begin construction of a pump track and skills course at Trail Creek Park. We have an agreement with [Firefly Trail, Inc.](https://www.fireflytrail.com/) to build a singletrack trail parallel to the Firefly Trail in the town of Maxey's and we hope to find more parallel trail opportunities as the trail is constructed. We strive for sustainable trail design and maintenance practices. Please join us at one of our events or [donate](/donate/) to one of our trail funds to help support our work. 

We're all volunteers with day jobs, and we don't turn down help! If you have time or other resources to contribute please [get involved](/get_involved/) or contact us!
