If you arent able to volunteer, donations are another great way to support the trails you ride. Click the donate button and select a specific trail or project or donate for general chapter use.

## Donations and membership dollars help us:

+ hire contractors, purchase tools, and rent equipment for trail building and maintenance
+ host trail clases free of charge to members
+ travel to the regional meeting of [SORBA chapters](https:/sorba.org/chapters) which is an important part of our organizaitons structure and strength

## Other ways to donate

[Trail Care](https://www.trail.care/) allows you to make microdonations per mile by linking to your Strava activities. Land managers or trail organizations register their trails and the donations go to the trail stewards after you approve each donation. Trail Creek Park and Heritage Park are both set up to recieve funds through Trail Care.

[Luv Trails](https://www.luvtrails.com/) this is another new tool connecting donations with trail stewarding organizations. More to come, get the app.

[Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com) Search for 'Southern Off-Road Bicycle Association' and choose the 'Athes, GA' chapter
