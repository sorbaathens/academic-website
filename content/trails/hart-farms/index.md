This trail system consists of hand-cut single track that bisects a power line easement. Trails pop in and out of the woods and you are never far from the trail head, which has a covered picnic area, camper restroom and a bike wash station. The trails have a little bit of everything that comes with hand cut single track in an old hardwood growth forest.... roots, rocks, twisty turns, short punchy climbs, sweeping descents, creek crossing and a little bit of double track thrown in for good measure.

Please support the Hart Farms trails by riding them and making a small donation to help pay the annual lease. There is a donation box at the trail head or you can donate to our [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate?token=Wbs_Z565NoZL3nNSpUrZQVVOsnR1fuQ3tTKyvh7G4xcBplrQAVaMwi9tBMbWO-O0txFpG7PsiRrhzRnC) and designate to "Use this donation for" Hart Farms Trails.
