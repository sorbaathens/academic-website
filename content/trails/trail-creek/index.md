**Trail Creek Park** offers just under 5 miles of trails which include beginner, intermediate and advanced trails and offers something for all skill levels. This winter we will begin construction of a [pump track](/pump-track/) at Trail Creek Park.

**There are 5 trails at Trail Creek**:

+ **Green (green)** is beginner friendly and a great introduction to mountain biking.
+ **Orange Crush (orange)** is beginner/intermediate with dips and berms including a fun bermy ravine called **Sidewinder**.
+ **Drive-By Truckers (blue)** is beginner/intermediate with dips, berms, rollers and rock features as well as a short optional downhill section called **3 Dimes Down**. 
+ **Panic (yellow)** is beginner/intermediate with a downhill only section with lots of tight berms, a couple of optional jumps, and an optional rock drop that ends at the shoals near the bridge. 
+ **Widespread (red)** is intermediate/advanced downhill only trail with huge berms and jumps. Widespread is for mountain bikes only.  No pedestrian traffic is allowed.
+ Under construction - **Comeback Sauce** will be a return trail from the bottom of Widespread/Panic back to the top without crossing the road, keep an eye out for volunteer opportunitites.
