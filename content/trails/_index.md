There are 5 primary trails at Trail Creek:

+ **Orange Crush (orange)** is beginner/intermediate with dips and berms including a fun bermy ravine called **Sidewinder**.
+ **Drive-By Truckers (blue)** is beginner/intermediate with dips, berms, rollers and rock features as well as a short optional downhill section called **3 Dimes Down**. 
+ **Panic (yellow)** is beginner/intermediate with a downhill only section with lots of tight berms, a couple of optional jumps, and an optional rock drop that ends at the shoals near the bridge. 
+ **Widespread (red)** is intermediate/advanced downhill only trail with huge berms and jumps. Widespread is for mountain bikes only.  No pedestrian traffic is allowed.
+ To be built -- **Comeback Sauce** soon we will begin construction of a return trail from the bottom of Widespread/Panic back to the top without crossing the road, keep an eye out for volunteer opportunitites.
