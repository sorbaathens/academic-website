We are building a pump track at Walker Park in Athens, GA! It has taken us a long time to get here, but construction is underway! Thank you [Bandit Built, LLC](https://banditbuilt.com/) for making it happen despite all the challenges of 2020!

In addition to the Pump Track construction, we are also building a skills course at Walker Park! The course will include wooden features like skinnies, progressive drops, wall rides and other skill-building features. The primary goal of this new course is to allow space for children and other developing riders to practice and acquire skills in a more controlled setting, where they can gain the practice and confidence that they need to enjoy the pre-existing trails at Walker Park.  We are hoping to have the skills course built by Fall 2021!

The conceptual plan for the pump track site includes pump track space for beginners up to experts as well as space to hang out and enjoy the show. The final product won't look exactly like the drawing, but it gives us an idea of the final goal.
