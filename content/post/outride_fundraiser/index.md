Walker Park is located in District 2 in Athens-Clarke County.  District 2 is the only majority-minority district in Athens with a poverty rate for children above fifty percent. Walker Park is also located within walking distance from two affordable housing communities and an elementary school.  There are currently more than five miles of natural surface trails at Walker Park that are open to bikes, including two purpose built downhill mountain bike trails.
