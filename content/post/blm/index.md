summary: "For those protesting injustice, marginalization and hate, SORBA Athens stands with you in solidarity"
---

SORBA Athens is a mountain bike advocacy, education and resource-sharing organization committed to increased access of all people to both the sport of mountain biking and sustainable trails close to home.  Yet, we don't reflect the larger communities in which we ride and we are not doing enough about it.  

Consequently, SORBA Athens has fallen woefully short in our mission.   We have been slack in our efforts to help marginalized communities overcome the numerous barriers of entry to our sport.  We need to tighten up! We challenge you to join us in taking a hard look inward and help us hold ourselves accountable for doing more.  

We are ashamed to say our board is all white and we currently have no ongoing educational programming targeting children from communities that are severely underrepresented in the sport.  Those among us who participated in youth recreation leagues with players of diverse racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds greatly benefited from such experiences -- learning to see everyone as a part of their same team and not some "other" to be feared or rejected.

In June 2020, there will be a ground breaking at the Walker Park (formerly Trail Creek Park) pump track. Once this infrastructure is in place, we need your help to implement bike programing for kids.  We will be challenging you to donate high quality bikes and coaching hours so we can work to increase access to our sport.   We will also be looking to you to help us advocate for installation of the two basketball courts that were an important part of our unfunded SPLOST 2020 proposal -- intended to support cross-over of user groups.  The next generation of riders (and much needed leadership within the bike community) is out there excluded by the many barriers to entry.  Yet we are a collective of bridge builders and trail blazers capable of overcoming great obstacles.  Inequity is an obstacle we must leverage our energy to help overcome. 

We have had educational programming in the past.  In 2013, Tyler Dewey and Richard Vercoe started a small mountain biking program out of the East Athens Community Center. They had a limited number of bikes and equipment but utilized the nearby trails at Walker Park (formerly Trail Creek). The program gained a lot of interest. The number of participants exceeded the number of bikes.  The kids happily took turns on the bikes for the chance to access the coaching, the bikes and our amazing sport. Unfortunately, Richard and Tyler left Athens for work and the program fizzled. We must get it going again, with more coaches and more bikes.  We've got to build stoke beyond our small network of insiders...and we can.

Rebranding also appears necessary to support accessibility to mountain biking locally.  SORBA Athens is not an intuitive name, more often begging the question of meaning and mission. We believe 'Mountain Bike Athens' would be a more obvious, self-explanatory name.  Other SORBA chapters have elected to identify themselves without use of the cumbersome, unfamiliar acronym and we feel it is time we do the same.  A name change will not overcome past injustice or inequality.  However, we appreciate that within the bike community the overuse of obscure, technical language has the potential to exclude and alienate.  We seek a new approach.

We have not been a strong enough voice for change.  We have not done enough to break down barriers to access and we have not strengthened our community partnerships in a way that will enable us to overcome those barriers.  We must evolve to better reflect and represent the larger communities within which we ride. We are committed to that inherently rewarding work and we ask you to join us.  Together, we can be more inclusive...and way more rad.
