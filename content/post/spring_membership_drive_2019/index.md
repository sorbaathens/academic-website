SORBA's spring membership drive is underway! We've been hard at work maintaining our trails and advocating for permission to build more mountain biking opportunities FOR YOU!

Join or renew your SORBA membership during the month of May and you are entered to win prize packs from IMBA including trips and bikes (see list below). In addition SORBA-Athens will have drawings for prizes available only to members of our chapter that renew or join during the month of May. See details below.
